R vs (H, T) modes:

** All temperature related measurements to be done under stepped ramp

** R-H as a function of T

	>> Stabilize T

	>> Bring sample in magnetic steady state
		-- Parameters: H_max, H_rate, cycles

	>> Record R vs H

** R-T as under constant H

	Scan over temperature

		>> Stabilize T

		>> Bring sample in magnetic steady state
			-- Parameters: H_max, H_rate, cycles

		>> Apply H
			-- Parameters: H_rate

		>> Record R
